abstract= "Ground vibration from traffic or construction work in cities is a known source of annoyance to inhabitants. However, vibration and re-radiated noise in buildings caused by exterior sources are seldom treated properly in the design process, which may be due to the lack of methodologies that can aid informed decision-making with respect to environmental vibration. To achieve efficient evaluation of ground vibration levels, the present paper proposes the use of surrogate models for evaluation of the transmission loss in onethird octave bands at a given distance from a vertical source on a layered ground. Polynomial Chaos Expansion is employed, and the frequency range relevant to human whole-body vibration is considered, ie, 1â€“80Hz. Stochastic variability in soil properties is propagated to variability in transmission losses, and the quality of the ..."
