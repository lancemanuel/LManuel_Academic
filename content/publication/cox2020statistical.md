abstract= "The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) of ambient noise measurement is commonly used to estimate a site's resonance frequency (⁠f_0⁠). For sites with a strong impedance contrast, the HVSR peak frequency (⁠f_{0,HVSR}⁠) has been shown to be a good estimate of f_0. However, the random nature of ambient noise (both in time and space), in conjunction with variable environmental conditions and sensor coupling issues, can lead to uncertainty in f_{0,HVSR} estimates. Hence, it is important to report f_{0,HVSR} in a statistical manner (e.g. as a mean or median value with standard deviation). In this paper, we first discuss widely accepted procedures to process HVSR data and estimate the variance in f_{0,HVSR}⁠. Then, we propose modifications to improve these procedures in two specific ways. First, we propose using a lognormal distribution to describe f_{0,HVSR} rather than the more commonly used normal distribution. The use of a lognormal distribution for f_{0,HVSR} has several advantages, including consistency with earthquake ground motion processing and allowing for a seamless transition between HVSR statistics in terms of both frequency and its reciprocal, period. Second, we introduce a new frequency-domain window-rejection algorithm to decrease variance and enhance data quality. Finally, we use examples of 114 high-variance HVSR measurements and 77 low-variance HVSR measurements collected at two case study sites to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new rejection algorithm and the proposed statistical approach. To encourage their adoption, and promote standardization, the rejection algorithm and lognormal statistics presented in this paper have been incorporated into hvsrpy, an open-source Python package for HVSR processing."
