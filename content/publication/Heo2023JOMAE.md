abstract= "An offshore energy transition, even if only a gradual one, from carbon-emitting fossil fuel extraction to cleaner sources is recommended, if we are to slow the harmful impacts of climate change. The potential for sustainable reuse of decommissioned offshore jacket platforms to support wind turbines is being considered as an attractive proposition in such a transition. To maximize the benefits of such reuse of assets, what is needed is a rational optimization strategy that considers the remaining life of a repurposed platform, associated retrofit and construction costs, and a future period of gross renewable energy generation following installation of the wind turbine. We outline a study that employs a fatigue reliability-based framework, based on the global fatigue approach and Palmgren–Miner’s rule, to aid in such sustainable reuse planning and optimization. The framework proposed identifies an optimized reuse plan that incorporates metocean data analysis, structural analysis, life cycle evaluation, and revenue optimization. We employ a case study and sustainable reuse scenario for a site in the vicinity of Porto (Leixões), Portugal."
