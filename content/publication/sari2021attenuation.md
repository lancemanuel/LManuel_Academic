abstract= "The intensity of ground shaking and the demand on structures during earthquakes have been generally characterized using parameters such as peak ground acceleration as well as strength-based parameters such as response spectrum ordinates (e.g., spectral acceleration) that represent the maximum amplitude of shaking for structures with specified natural period and damping values. It has long been recognized that to assess the demands on structures during earthquakes, one might employ an energy-based approach (as an alternative to the more common strength-based one), especially when there is an interest in assessing damage potential of ground motions. An energy spectrum, obtained with the same level of effort required to construct a conventional response spectrum, is a convenient single-parameter description of both amplitude and duration of ground motion and can serve as a useful means by which to describe the performance of structures with different natural periods and damping ratios."
