abstract= "The simulation of wind and wave fields for the evaluation of jacket-supported offshore wind turbines during Hurricane Sandy of 2012 is the focus of this study. For realistic load assessment of offshore wind turbines, it is important that coupled wind, wave, and current fields with appropriate spatial resolution are provided throughout the evolution of the hurricane. A numerical model describing the hurricane track and intensity variation with time is used to generate the coupled wind, wave, and current fields. Time series of turbulent wind fields and coupled wave kinematics are generated using the hurricane simulation output, and a detailed procedure is presented. These coupled wind, wave, and current fields form the inputs for the analysis of a 5-MW offshore wind turbine supported on a jacket platform sited in 50 m of water and assumed located in the path of Hurricane Sandy. The turbine’s and support structure’s performance under the simulated loading conditions is the subject of a separate study."
