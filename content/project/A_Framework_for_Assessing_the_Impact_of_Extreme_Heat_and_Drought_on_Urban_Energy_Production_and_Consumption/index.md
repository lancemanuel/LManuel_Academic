Goal: The major goals of this project include the development of an integrative methodology that (a) defines appropriate climate scenarios for city-scale extreme heat and drought events; (b) offers a framework to be used at the city scale to assess the impacts of extreme heat and drought on the two main elements of the modern electricity gridâ€”consumption and production; and (c) describes a robust decision-making framework to prepare for extreme weather conditions in order to maintain a high level power grid reliability.
