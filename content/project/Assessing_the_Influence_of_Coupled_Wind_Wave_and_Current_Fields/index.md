Goal: The simulation of hurricane-induced coupled wind, wave, and current fields and the associated response evaluation of bottom-supported offshore wind turbine using these coupled inputs are the primary objectives of this study. In particular, we are concerned with three chief research objectives: (i) to investigate the physical characteristics of hurricane-generated wind, waves, and currents; (ii) to generate time series input of turbulent wind fields and wave kinematics using the hurricane simulation output; and (iii) to predict and interpret the response of offshore turbines during Hurricanes Ike (2008) and Sandy (2012) using the assembled turbulent wind fields, wave kinematics, and current fields.
