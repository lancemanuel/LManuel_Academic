Goal: Wind turbines offer a complex set of prediction issues: wind statistics, loads on turbine elements rotationally sampling the wind, and material properties (e.g., S--N curve, other statistics that govern fatigue). Here we bring reliability methods (FORM, IFORM, Environmental Contours, Moment-Based Fitting) to address these issues.
