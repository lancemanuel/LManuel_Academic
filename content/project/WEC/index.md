Goal: Of interest in this study is the long-term response and performance of a two-body wave point absorber that serves as a wave energy converter (WEC). The device consisting of a float and a reaction plate; power generation results from wave-induced heave motion. In our previous studies, the short-term uncertainty in response was assessed for a severe sea state. We now address the long-term response by considering all sea states possible at a site of interest. We will demonstrate how simulation tools may be used to evaluate the long-term response using performance parameters of the WEC device, such as the heave force on the power takeoff (PTO) system and the PTO extension. We employ environmental data from a designated deployment site in Northern California using 15 years of metocean data.
