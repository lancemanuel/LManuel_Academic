Goal: In wind resource-rich regions such as the U.S. Great Plains, wind energy development continues to proceed at a brisk rate. These regions also often experience severe weather events such as thunderstorms. Failures of wind turbine components in recent events suggest the need for a study that is concerned with the simulation of complex inflow conditions that occur during thunderstorm downbursts and of the associated performance of wind turbines during these transient events.
