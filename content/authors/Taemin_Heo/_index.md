My name is Taemin Heo. I received B.S. and M.S. degrees in Civil Environmental Engineering from Seoul National University in South Korea. I joined UT CAEE MUSE in Fall 2018 for a Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Professor Lance Manuel. I am interested in stochastic processes. Currently, I am studying reliability, resilience and future risk increases of the spatiotemporal stochastic systems along with climate change.
