Research Interests:
- Infrastructure health monitoring
- Development of data repositories for multi-hazards
- Disaster data reconnaissance, data management, and curation
- Ontology development for collecting infrastructure damage data
- Behavior of new and sustainable material for reinforced concrete members
- Advanced instrumentation with non-contact sensors and testing of structural components
- Structural members under extreme load events (blast, earthquake, wind, corrosion, etc.)
- Modeling and testing of structural concrete, or steel-concrete composite structures

Research Experience:
Both experimental and analytical studies in concrete structures, steel-concrete composite structures, wind turbine load analysis, and fatigue behavior of composite structures

Technical Experience:
Most of the consulting and design experience as structural engineer was in the design of medium and short-span bridge structures, cable stress analysis (Fine-tuning) of cable-stayed bridge structures, crack and tansverse analysis of prestressed concrete box girder bridges, structural safety check of sewage box structures, structural analysis of tunnels in subway structures, and structural safety check of sign post structures, et cetera.
