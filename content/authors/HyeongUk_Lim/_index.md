I am working as an upstream data analyst in Stress Engineering Services. I obtained B.E from Kyung Hee University and M.S from KAIST in South Korea. My research has focused on the development of computational methods that address surrogate modeling, sensitivity analysis, and dimension reduction for efficient uncertainty quantification in structural dynamics problems.
