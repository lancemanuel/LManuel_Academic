PhD student in Civil Engineering, experienced in Structural Engineering, Uncertainty Quantification using simulation-based and metamodel-based methods, and utilities for various tasks within probabilistic risk assessments; reliability analysis of offshore structures under stochastic wind and wave loads; characterizing extreme environment for offshore structures; vulnerability/resilience analysis under extreme climate events. Technical proficiencies include:

Methodologies: Environmental contours, FORM/I-FORM, stochastic simulation (MCS, Important sampling, variance reduction sampling techniques), surrogate models (polynomial chaos expansion, low-rank tensor, stochastic colocation, Gaussian process) for uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis, data-driven models, dimension reduction (slice inverse regression, active subspace, PCA, ICA), structural dynamics, finite element methods, numerical methods for linear and nonlinear systems.

Programming: Matlab, Python.

Current Research: (1) Characterize extreme environments for estimating long-term extreme loads in offshore structures using environmental contour methods, (2) develop multi- polynomial chaos expansion for long-term extreme loads in offshore structures, and (3) develop mixed sliced inverse regression and polynomial chaos expansion for uncertainty quantification in high-dimensional stochastic models for extreme loads, (4) develop theoretical/stochastic simulation framework for assessing uncertainty in climate-resilient infrastructure assets under extreme climate events.
