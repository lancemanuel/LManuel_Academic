A motivated professional driven towards delivering creative and practical solutions to complex problems. Over the span of my career, I have held engineering and leadership roles delivering development strategies, engineering design and offshore construction activities of subsea systems for multi-billion dollar deep-water oil and gas facilities. Strong analytical aptitude, strategic mindset, deep technical know-how, interpersonal skills and the drive towards continuous improvement have helped me work with, as well as manage, multiple teams of talented professionals in delivering sustainable engineering designs, offshore execution and operations for large scale, capital intensive projects.

I am passionate about leveraging technology to modernize and transform day to day business activities and improve productivity. Of particular interest to me are the impacts of technology breakthroughs in reshaping traditional industries like oil & gas and energy, for sustainable growth and reduction in carbon footprint.

Outside the professional sphere, I enjoy volunteering for non profit organizations like National Multiple Sclerosis Society and participating in charity fundraising events like MS150, Tour de Pink and Tour de Cure. In addition, I am an avid reader, travel enthusiast and love the outdoors.
