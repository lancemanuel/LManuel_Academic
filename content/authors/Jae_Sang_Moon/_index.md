I'm researcher/engineer specialized in numerical analysis/modeling/simulation of physical features. Specifically, I have been working on following areas:

- Stochastic modeling/analysis of turbine-generated wake field.  
- Analysis/Simulation of dynamic features (wind field, seismic loading) based on stochastic methods.  
- Time/Frequency domain analysis of MDOF structures (Wind Turbine, building, bridge).  
- Optimization technique (Iterative, heuristic, and combinatorial algorithms)  
- CFD: Large eddy simulation of atmospheric field and wind turbine.  
- FEM: Analysis of structures(blades, structures) using commercial programs.  
- Statistical analysis and Reliability based modeling of physical features.  
- Data processing using parallel computation.  
- High performance computation.  
- Wind tunnel testing.  
- Wind turbine blade design and performance analysis.  
- Wind farm site assessment: GIS based analysis
