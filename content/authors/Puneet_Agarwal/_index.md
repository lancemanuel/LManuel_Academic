My focus is on delivering value to stakeholders by solving their engineering problems. Broad areas of my expertise are structural mechanics, ocean engineering, probabilistic mechanics, data analysis, machine learning, and reliability. I have demonstrated ability to learn new topics quickly. I am currently applying my skills to floating oil and gas (production and drilling) systems. Prior to that, I have worked in wind energy.

I am keenly interested in the analysis of measured data with the goal of health monitoring or identifying any problems (e.g., fatigue of risers) in a system. I employ a suite of statistical tools along with the knowledge of system mechanics to achieve these goals.

My doctoral work on load estimation methods for wind turbines has been published extensively. I continue to publish work out of my consulting projects. I believe that writing papers and staying current with the technical literature would make one a more effective engineer.

I also believe in service to the engineering community. I am actively involved in organizing sessions in conferences.
