I have over 10 years of experience in practicing structural engineering. I am currently a Senior Engineer at Walter P Moore overseeing analysis and design of several projects.

I have expertise in complex non-linear analyses of structures, applying computational geometry algorithms to rationalize complex architectural forms into buildable structures. On several projects I have applied form finding techniques to develop light weight structural forms. I am keen about application of optimization algorithms to design of structures.

I also have a background in programming. I have developed custom software and workflows to support digital practice thought Walter P Moore. I have also customized several software through their application programming interface (API) e.g., Revit, SAP2000 Tekla. I have worked in VB6, C# and Python programming platforms.

I enjoy promoting the use of technology through seminars, blog posts, workshops and development of custom workflows.
