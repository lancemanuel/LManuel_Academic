My name is Jinsong Liu. I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a B.S. degree in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering. I joined UT in the fall of 2013 and my research advisor is Dr. Lance Manuel. My current research topic is related to the modeling and simulation of a floating offshore wind turbine.
